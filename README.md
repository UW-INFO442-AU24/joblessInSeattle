## Our Mission
As college students with limited time and busy schedules, doctor visits are not the first priority, and as a result, students may brush off their health issues as short-term problems when in fact, they may be more serious. This could mean ignoring signs of serious injury or possible diseases and not scheduling regular visits. Many health issues are preventable and treatable, but without the proper care and attention to them, can become serious risks. **With our project, we are planning to specifically address promoting self-care and personal health by encouraging college students to actively think about their health and get into a habit of keeping track of and monitoring ongoing issues.**
